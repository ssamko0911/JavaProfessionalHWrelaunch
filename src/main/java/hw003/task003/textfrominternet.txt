Java programs can have two kinds of comments: implementation comments and
documentation comments. Implementation comments are those found in C++, which are
delimited by /*...*/, and //. Documentation comments (known as “doc comments”) are
Java-only, and are delimited by /**...*/. Doc comments can be extracted to HTML files
using the javadoc tool.
